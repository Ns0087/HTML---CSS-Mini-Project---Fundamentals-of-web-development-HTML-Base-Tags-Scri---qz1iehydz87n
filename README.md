### Why this project was chosen?
I had chosen this project because I am also fond of photography and I do Mobile Photogrpahy.
Photography allows you to create images of special events, times, and places. It lets you record the specifics of an event – and it also allows you to share that event with friends and family, long after it’s done and gone.
As the saying goes, “A picture is worth a thousand words.”
